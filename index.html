	<h1>SKINNIN CRIDDERS</h1>
	<h3>Road Kill Critters</h3>

	<h2>Skunk</h2>
	<p>Go to your local feed store and buy a large hypodermic syringe and needle. Get a canning jar with a good rubber sealing lid. Lay that skunk on his back with his tail stretched out so nothing will go off by mistake. Feel along side the vent, to find the sacks- about thumb sized. Stick in your needle and when you can feel that you've gone through the first wall of the sack, start drawing out the essence. You've just made the skunk a lot safer to skin, and now have some lure for just about anything you would trap.</p>

	<h2>Possum</h2>
	<p>  What is the nature of its illness? Ha. Like any other skin, it should be removed from the animal and all traces of flesh and fat removed. Be especially careful around the lips, eyes, and ears, and don't miss anything at the base of the whiskers. Stretch it out and rub borax into the skin side to dry it. Borax is relatively cheap, so be generous.
